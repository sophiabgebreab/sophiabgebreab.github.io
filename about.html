            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Sophia.</p>
            <p>I am a multi-disciplinary student lost in time and space who is completing a BA in media arts & design with a minor in astronomy & astrophysics and an MA in digital studies of language, culture, and history. I have studied drawing, painting, and theater for as long as I can remember and am now embracing computers and other modern technology. I have studied data privacy and the intersection of science and art in my time at the University of Chicago, though, lately, I have had fiber and book arts, robotics, and puppets on the brain. 
    
                <br>
                <br>Outside of school, I spend a lot of time working on my zine, which I have been publishing with my friend since 2019, thinking about the “grand scheme of things”, and taping whatever I find to my walls. My latest small pleasures include tai chi, writing mini-reviews in my pocket-notebook, and attending weekly meetings for my soup club.</p>
